Problem One:

If the value is the tail, it is queued for deletion.

When you access that value with get, it needs to be removed from 
the tail and appended to the front.

Otherwise, the value can be left alone?

Why am I using a doubly linked list if I'm just using it like a normal 
one?

Problem Two:

Using recursion, I can infinitely travel into the subdirectories.

That's good. Now, the next step is to keep going into the subdirectories
until I reach file(s). Return those files. Then, loop through to see 
if any have the suffix.

Once you get to the "bottom" of the subdirectory, get back up to the
beginning to move on to the next one.

Files is initialized as an empty list. As you traverse the subdirectories,
add files as they are found. Once all have been found, then search
through and figure out which have the suffix.
